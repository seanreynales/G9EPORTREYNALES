<p><font size="4"><br><br>Teacher's Day this school year was somehow different. 10 of my classmates became mini teachers, in which they discussed various lessons according to their assigned subject. After a dance number and song number, we ate food from Shakeys. The teachers then played a minigame. And lastly, Ms. Gia performed the song "Part of Your World." </p>

<p><font size="4"><br><br> Helping out in the making of cultural icon was amazing. I was part of the fabric-cutting department and the painting department. I really loved it when I was painting the paper roses. The other painters and I were tasked to paint the roses red and blue. </p>

<p><font size="4"><br><br> Having V-POP again this school year was actually fun. In my opinion, our song choices were cool. I can say that the choreography was tiring, but we got used to it since we practiced that over and over.</p>
